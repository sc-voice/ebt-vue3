<h3>Integrity of the Teachings</h3>
<p>One of the great challenges facing all Buddhists is preserving the integrity of the teachings. The Buddha speaks plainly of this challenge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.130/en/sujato#an1.130:1.0" target="_blank">AN1.130:1.0</a>: 130<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.130/en/sujato#an1.130:1.1" target="_blank">AN1.130:1.1</a>: “Mendicants, those mendicants who explain what is not the teaching as the teaching are acting for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans.<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.130/en/sujato#an1.130:1.2" target="_blank">AN1.130:1.2</a>: They create much wickedness and make the true teaching disappear.”<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.131/en/sujato#an1.131:1.0" target="_blank">AN1.131:1.0</a>: 131<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.131/en/sujato#an1.131:1.1" target="_blank">AN1.131:1.1</a>: “Mendicants, those mendicants who explain what is the teaching as not the teaching are acting for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans.<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.131/en/sujato#an1.131:1.2" target="_blank">AN1.131:1.2</a>: They create much wickedness and make the true teaching disappear.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddhist Saṅgha (ordained monks and nuns) is in charge of the integrity of the Buddha's teaching.
For Buddhist content to be considered a <em>great reference</em>, it should be verified as explained in AN4.180. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#an4.180:9.1" target="_blank">AN4.180:9.1</a>: Take another mendicant who says:<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#an4.180:9.2" target="_blank">AN4.180:9.2</a>: ‘In such-and-such monastery there is a single senior mendicant who is very learned, an inheritor of the heritage, who has memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines.<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#an4.180:9.3" target="_blank">AN4.180:9.3</a>: I’ve heard and learned this in the presence of that senior mendicant:<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#an4.180:9.4" target="_blank">AN4.180:9.4</a>: this is the teaching, this is the training, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#an4.180:9.5" target="_blank">AN4.180:9.5</a>: You should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant’s statement.<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#an4.180:9.6" target="_blank">AN4.180:9.6</a>: Instead, having carefully memorized those words and phrases, you should make sure they fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training.<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#an4.180:9.7" target="_blank">AN4.180:9.7</a>: If they fit in the discourse and are exhibited in the training, you should draw the conclusion:<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#an4.180:9.8" target="_blank">AN4.180:9.8</a>: ‘Clearly this is the word of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.<br>
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.180/en/sujato#an4.180:9.9" target="_blank">AN4.180:9.9</a>: It has been correctly memorized by that senior mendicant.’</p>
