<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>As creators and caretakers of this website,
we were inspired by <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn8" target="_blank">Middle Discourses 8</a>
to create a code of conduct to guide our use of AI.
We abide by the following rules of conduct,
and ask you to review these rules and consider doing the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Others will be cruel, but here we will not be cruel.’<br>
‘Others will kill living creatures, but here we will not kill living creatures.’<br>
‘Others will steal, but here we will not steal.’<br>
‘Others will lie, but here we will not lie.’<br>
‘Others will have sexual misconduct, but here we will not have sexual misconduct.’<br>
‘Others will speak divisively, but here we will not speak divisively.’<br>
‘Others will speak harshly, but here we will not speak harshly.’<br>
‘Others will talk nonsense, but here we will not talk nonsense.’<br>
